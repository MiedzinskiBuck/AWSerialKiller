# AWSERIALKILLER

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)

The main idea of this tool is to implement a few checks that I usually do when assessing an AWS Environment.

This is still experimental and still under development.

I understand that the code is not structured in the best way. Suggestions are more than appreciated.

## To Do

- Convert application to interactive application.
- Implement some way to store data.
- Start implementing privesc modules.

## MODULES 

### MISC
### ENUMERATION
### PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
### LATERAL MOVEMENT
### EXFILTRATION
### DEFENSE EVASION

## AVAILABLE FUNCTIONALITIES

This section is used to map the functions that I had previously implemented to help me refactor it.

- Console
- Key Information
- iam_recon
- s3_recon
- brute_role
- ec2_list_instances
- ec2_start_instances
- ec2_stop_instances
